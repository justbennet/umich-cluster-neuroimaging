This site provides some introductory material &ndash; explanations of
concepts and examples &ndash; for running some common neuroimaging
software on the clusters provided by the University of Michigan (UM).

While it is specifically aimed at UM clusters, the concepts apply
broadly, and the examples should provide a good starting point to
use any cluster that uses Slurm for job management.

Please refer to the Table of Contents to the right for specific
topics.  If you are just getting started, you should start with
the Introduction to cluster computing and skim the topics in
order.
